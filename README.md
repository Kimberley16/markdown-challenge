#####Okey so when I was 5 years old, I really wanted a little sister, so I was always asking my mom to have one. And one day, my wish cam true and my mom told me that she was pregnant, but also that I will have to wait 9 months to see the baby. But I really wanted to see and her didn't really understand why I have to wait that long, and I was wondering 'where is she now?'So my mom just tell Ã¹e that she was in her belly.One day, I was quite impatient and... I litteraly ask my mom if I could juste open her belly to take my sister out x').Now, my parents like to remind me this, because I wasn't smart at that age and didn't even realize that it should just kill my mom and the baby, like I was really sure that it was okey x')#####
